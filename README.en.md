# DSH WorkBuddy XD Pool

English | [中文](./README.md)

Merge **every WorkBuddy account** you have ever signed into on this machine into a single **DeepSeek Harness model pool**. No manual setup: each account you sign in on the WorkBuddy desktop app automatically becomes a pool member, and when one account gets rate-limited (HTTP 429), requests automatically fail over to the next healthy account.

> Unlike single-account connectors (e.g. `dsh-workbuddy-connect`), XD Pool treats multi-account as the norm — it never picks or imports an account by hand. It scans every historical sign-in snapshot left by the WorkBuddy desktop app, merges them all into one shared pool, and exposes them as a single `workbuddy-xdpool` provider group whose requests auto-fail-over across members.

## Features

- **Zero-config**: install, enable, done. Every account signed into the WorkBuddy desktop app is auto-discovered into the rotation pool on first use.
- **Automatic failover**: the pool tracks each account's `429` cooldown. A cooling account is skipped in favor of the next healthy one; cooldowns expire automatically. Requests pause only when every account is cooling at once.
- **Pool health at a glance**: the settings card shows pool health (N accounts / X cooling, which account is next), each account's token expiry, and cooldown countdowns.
- **Live remaining credits**: per-account credit packages (`package · remain / size`) and a big green total, refreshed from upstream in real time.
- **Annotated model catalog**: the card lists pool models with their credit multiplier (e.g. `GLM-5.2 · x0.79`), free / limited-free / night-discount tags, image-input capability, and context window — kept live from upstream `credits` / `tags`.
- **Two manual actions**: re-detect desktop sign-ins and clear all cooldowns, available both on the card and via the CLI.

## Install

Prerequisite: WorkBuddy desktop app installed and signed in (the plugin reuses the app's sign-in state; adding accounts = signing in / switching accounts in the desktop app — each is absorbed into the pool automatically). Tested against DSH Desktop host `0.1.2`; compatible with `0.1.1-rc.2` / `0.1.2` (the settings-section install picks `settings.installSection` on `0.1.2-rc.1+`, or the older free function earlier).

**Option A — install from GitHub (recommended)**

```sh
# if dsh is not on PATH, use node ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js instead
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:aosi526/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool
```

**Option B — manual bundle registration**

```sh
# 1) install the package
dsh plugin --profile desktop add github:aosi526/dsh-workbuddy-xdpool

# 2) register the bundle: edit ~/.dsh/profiles/desktop/package.json and append
#    "dsh-workbuddy-xdpool" to the end of the "dsh" → "profile" → "bundles" array

# 3) restart DSH Desktop
```

**Build locally** (developers):

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build                  # outputs lib/index.js + lib/bin.js + lib/client.js
pnpm typecheck              # host side
pnpm typecheck:client       # client side
```

> `pnpm install` needs pnpm 11 (`npx pnpm@11`); add `--config.confirmModulesPurge=false --config.minimumReleaseAge=0` if the supply-chain age policy blocks freshly published rc packages.

After install: a **WorkBuddy XD Pool** group appears in the model picker; Settings → Plugins → **DSH WorkBuddy XD Pool** card shows pool health, per-account tokens/credits/cooldowns, plus "Detect accounts again" and "Clear all cooldowns" buttons. Works on Web / TUI profiles too (`--profile web` / `--profile dsh-tui`).

## CLI

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool status    # pool accounts/cooldown + shim state (--credits, --json, --rates)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool accounts  # discovered accounts (--json)
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool doctor    # diagnose discovery/cooldown/upstream
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool reset     # clear all 429 cooldowns now
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool login     # guide to adding another desktop account
```

## How accounts get into the pool

Auto-discovery. Every sign-in on the WorkBuddy desktop app leaves a token-bearing snapshot; XD Pool scans them and absorbs each into the pool. So multi-account = sign in / switch accounts in the desktop app, then hit "Detect accounts again" or restart DSH.

To snapshot an extra login explicitly (e.g. to pin one account for verification):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool import myKey
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool accounts
dsh plugin --profile desktop exec dsh-workbuddy-xdpool remove myKey
```

Snapshots are stored under `~/.dsh/.workbuddy-xdpool/` named by the **MD5-8 prefix** of their key (so keys with Chinese, `/`, or spaces are safe). Long-lived use relies on refresh-token auto-renewal; if it lapses, re-sign-in on the desktop and `import <key> --force`.

## Configuration

Effective config is read from the plugin settings section (`settings.workbuddy-xdpool`), editable on the Models settings page and applied live:

| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `authFile` | Override the WorkBuddy desktop auth-file path (equiv. to `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE`) | auto-probed |
| `cooldownMs` | Per-account 429 cooldown in milliseconds | `60000` |

Or set it directly in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
workbuddy-xdpool:
  cooldownMs: 120000
```

## Architecture

- **Host side** (`src/`): registers the `workbuddy-xdpool` provider, the `workbuddy-xdpool` settings section (`settings.installSection`), three same-origin status/action routes, and account discovery + catalog seeding.
- **Client** (`src/client/`): the browser card loaded via `dsh.client`; the collapsible shell reuses the host's `dsm-plugin-card*` style language (`--dsw-alias-*` theme tokens), with content classes namespaced `dsm-workbuddy-xdpool-*`.
- **Build**: `tsdown` produces `lib/index.js` (host entry) + `lib/bin.js` (CLI) + `lib/client.js` (CJS browser bundle wrapped in `window.__ModuleLoader__.load`).

## Known limitations

- **Only accounts on this machine**: the pool cannot and will not perform WorkBuddy sign-in / QR auth for you (tokens are minted by the WorkBuddy desktop app's own Tencent SSO and are device-bound). Add accounts by signing in on the desktop app.
- Depends on WorkBuddy client endpoints (not an official public API); may need updates when WorkBuddy changes.
- If Windows/Linux usernames differ and Windows env vars aren't forwarded into WSL, point `WORKBUDDY_AUTH_FILE` or the config `authFile` at the real location.
